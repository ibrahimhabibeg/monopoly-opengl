# Monopoly Game using OpenGL

## About the Project

This is our submission for the practical exam of the Computer Graphics course (CSC 309) at Suez Canal University for the year 2025/2026. We were tasked to build an interactive game featuring visuals and animations using OpenGL.

We have decided to create Monopoly game. Our game handles the players rolling the dice. There is a 3D animation for the dice rolling. After the dice stops rolling, the player with the current turn is moved precisely according to the dice result and shows an animation for the player's movement.
